# Multiple Disease Prediction System

Welcome to the **Multiple Disease Prediction System**! 🎉

This project uses **Machine Learning** to help predict diseases like **Parkinson’s Disease**, **Kidney Disease**, and **Liver Disease** based on symptoms, test results, and demographic details you provide. It's designed to assist healthcare professionals with early detection and improve decision-making, making healthcare faster and more efficient! 🚑💻

---

## 🚀 **What’s the Goal?**

The system aims to:

- **Predict diseases** early on based on user input.
- Help **healthcare providers** make better decisions.
- Reduce diagnostic **time and costs** by giving quick predictions.

---

## 🔍 **Key Features**

- **Multi-Disease Prediction**: Get predictions for diseases like Kidney Disease, Liver Disease, and Parkinson’s Disease.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Input your data easily through a simple form.
- **Interactive Visualizations**: See charts and graphs to help you understand the predictions better.
- **Data Privacy**: We make sure your data is secure and follows all regulations.
- **Scalable**: The system can handle a lot of users and predict a variety of diseases.

## 🛠 **How It Works**

1. **Input Data**: You enter symptoms, test results, and demographic details into the app.
2. **Data Processing**: The system cleans the data (e.g., fills in missing values, adjusts categories, and scales numerical features).
3. **Model Prediction**: Machine learning models predict the probability of different diseases based on your input.
4. **Output**: You get a prediction with probabilities and risk levels for each disease.

## 📊 **Technologies Used**

- **Frontend**: We use **Streamlit** to create an easy-to-use interface.
- **Backend**: **Python** handles everything behind the scenes.
- **Machine Learning**: Models like **Logistic Regression**, **Random Forest**, and **XGBoost** help make predictions.
